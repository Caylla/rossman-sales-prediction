The objective of the project is to simulate a business problem to be solved by a Data Scientist. In this fictional scenario, our data source is a .csv file from a Kaggle competition, but it could be from the company's database, a set of spreadsheets, or other sources.

1. Business Problem
Rossmann's Chief Financial Officer will be implementing within the next weeks important remodeling across all units for the drugstore chain. To be able to complete such massive task, he decided to request from the Data Science team, a sales's projection for the next six weeks. With this information in hands, a responsible payment plan can be implemented with minimum financial risks to the stakeholders.

2. Objective
To forecast the revenue of the Rossmann pharmacy chain for the next 6 weeks. This forecast will be used by the CFO to guide investments in store renovations, enabling efficient allocation of resources and ensuring a better experience for consumers.
To provide a decision support tool, utilizing historical sales data to anticipate future trends and maximize return on investment.

3. Methodology
We will employ the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) approach, a versatile and widely-used method in various data science projects. The strategy is based on executing six phases to achieve results swiftly and enable continuous improvements throughout the process, from the initial understanding of the problem to the implementation of the solution.
